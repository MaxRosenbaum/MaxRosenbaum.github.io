I am working on a major in Journalism and a double minor in Psychology and Creative Writing. \r\n\r\nIf you would like to see a more comprehensive display of my work in both journalism and photography, please visit [My Website](http://www.maxlrosenbaum.com/)\r\n\r\n### Some examples of my work with Data Visualization\r\nThroughout the course of the semester, I have been taking a class in Data Visualization. I have since mastered many techniques that have allowed me to visually display information.\r\n\r\n**Examples:**\r\n\r\n* [A Map of My Favorite Restaurants in Nassau County, Long Island](MaxRosenbaum.github.io/map.html)\r\n* [A Timeline of Green Day's Discography](MaxRosenbaum.github.io/GreenDay.html)\r\n* [An Infographic About The Distribution of Lehigh Students Per College](https://maxrosenbaum.github.io/colleges.html)\r\n* [A Line Graph of Lehigh Enrollment Per College](MaxRosenbaum.github.io/lehighcolleges.html)\r\n* [A Map of U.S Green Day Concerts in the 2010's](MaxRosenbaum.github.io/GreenDayConcerts.html) \r\n\r\n### My Work With Social Media \r\n\r\nAs a journalist, I always try and stay updated with social media.
